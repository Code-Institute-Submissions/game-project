# Milestone Project One

## Personal Portfolio
![Portfolio](assets/readme/Preview.jpg)

Welcome to my second milestone project! For this project, I chose to create a personal portfolio. My 
    reasoning for this selection is based on the fact that I can use this project to come back to as I 
    progress through [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) and display my work in the "Projects" section of this page.

After researching full stack developer portfolios online (Google and YouTube), I noticed almost all developers implement a single page design. 
I like this design and chose to follow what seems to be the "norm" in this category.

This project on-top of being a milestone project also serves as a real-world project. I recently purchased a domain, which I will host 
this project on, however, I will wait to deploy this project on such a live environment until a later date where I may restrict access to 
items such as my CV.

## **Technologies Used**


---------------------
## **Testing**
To test this project I first used [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check all HTML, I then checked all of the CSS via the [W3 'Jigsaw' Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

![Testing](assets/readme/testing.jpg)

Adding to these tests, I used dev tools in my browser (Chrome) to see specific areas that I wanted to change. As this project is a front end project, the majority of my testing 
was that of design and the use of dev tools to achieve this.

Using Chrome Dev Tools, I viewed each section of this page on desktop, as well as both portrait and landscape layouts on tablet and mobile to ensure a 100% responsive design.
